# Alloy

Alloy is a log and metrics collection tool that is deployed on any server or cluster you want to collect metrics for.

Alloy is deployed on the Grafana, Loki, Prometheus server for meta-monitoring, or monitoring of the monitoring stack allowing
us to analyze the resource usage of the Grafana server itself.
